We are generating Car Tracking Query for a camera system. There are 5 scenarios of cameras in that system: 
1.	scenario 1 includes cameraID 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2.	Scenario 2 includes cameraID 6, 7, 8, 9
3.	Scenario 3 includes cameraID: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
4.	Scenario 4 includes cameraID: [16 to 40]
5.	Scenario 5 includes cameraID: 10, [16 to 29], [33 to 36]
Generate 20 car tracking queries for each scenario (totally 100 queries for 5 scenarios) using the following structure and components: 
<Scenario ID>: Track all the <color> <vehicle_type> that appear in camera <cameraID> <time>, and also appear at camera <cameraIDs> 
Components: 
1.	<color> (Choose one): white, black, red, blue, gray, grey, silver, brown, maroon, purple, green, tan, gold, yellow 
2.	<vehicle_type> (Choose one): sedan, SUV, truck, pickup, van, wagon, hatchback, coupe, jeep, minivan 
3.	<cameraID>: based on scenario ID, choose 1 random cameraID from list of cameraIDs above. Let call it original_cameraID
4.	<time> follow the format “from <time1> to <time2>” where:
a.	 <time1> are in the range [15-60] second
b.	<time2> are in the range [120-240] second
5.	<cameraIDs>: based on scenario ID, let choose randomly 1 to 3 cameraIDs from the list of cameraIDs above. Make sure the new cameraIDs are different from the original_cameraID
Example Output: 
•	Scenario 1: Track all the white sedan that appear in camera 1 from 15 second to 135 second, and also appear at camera 2,3 
•	Scenario 2: Track all the black suv that appear in camera 7 from 30 second to 153 second, and also appear at camera 8
•	Scenario 3: Track all the grey truck that appear in camera 14 from 53 second to 207, and also appear at camera 11, 13 
•	Scenario 4: Track all the green sedan that appear in camera 22 from 18 second to 221, and also appear at camera 25, 29
•	Scenario 5: Track all the yellow hatchback that appear in camera 28 from 59 second to 239 second, and also appear at camera 17, 32 

Give the output in 2 columns format: column 1 is ScenarioID and column 2 is the queries
