We are generating Car Tracking Query for a camera system. There are 5 scenarios of cameras in that system: 
1)	scenario 1 includes cameraID 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2)	Scenario 2 includes cameraID 6, 7, 8, 9
3)	Scenario 3 includes cameraID: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
4)	Scenario 4 includes cameraID: [16 to 40]
5)	Scenario 5 includes cameraID: 10, [16 to 29], [33 to 36]
Generate 20 car tracking queries for each scenario (totally 100 queries for 5 scenarios) using the following structure and components: 
<Scenario ID>: Track all the <color> <vehicle_type> that moving from <direction1> to <direction2> in camera <cameraID>  <time>, and also appear at camera <cameraIDs> 
Components: 
1.	<color> (Choose one): white, black, red, blue, gray, grey, silver, brown, maroon, purple, green, tan, gold, yellow 
2.	<vehicle_type> (Choose one): sedan, SUV, truck, pickup, van, wagon, hatchback, coupe, jeep, minivan 
3.	<direction1> (Choose one): left, right, top, bottom
4.	<direction2> : Choose one from left, right, top, bottom but must be different to <direction1>
5.	<cameraID>: based on scenario ID, choose 1 random cameraID from list of cameraIDs above. Let call it original_cameraID
6.	<time> follow the format “from <time1> to <time2>” where:
a.	<time1> are in the range [15-60] second
b.	<time2> are in the range [120-240] second
7.	<cameraIDs>: based on scenario ID, let choose randomly 1 to 3 cameraIDs from the list of cameraIDs above. Make sure the new cameraIDs are different from the original_cameraID
Example Output: 
•	Scenario 1: Track all the white sedan that moving from left to right in camera 1 from 15 second to 135 second, and also appear at camera 2,3 
•	Scenario 2: Track all the black suv that moving from top to bottom in camera 7 from 30 second to 153 second, and also appear at camera 8
•	Scenario 3: Track all the grey truck that moving from top to left in camera 14 from 53 second to 207, and also appear at camera 11, 13 
•	Scenario 4: Track all the green sedan that moving from left to right in camera 22 from 18 second to 221, and also appear at camera 25, 29
•	Scenario 5: Track all the yellow hatchback that moving from right to bottom in camera 28 from 59 second to 239 second, and also appear at camera 17, 32 

Give the output in 2 columns format: column 1 is ScenarioID and column 2 is the queries
